## How to use this
To run this library it is enough to download the src floder and run the makefile. This implementation includes implementation of different datastructures from sratch. 

## Vector

* Insert
O(n)
* Acessing an element
O(1)
* Search
1. O(n) in a unsorted vector
2. O(log(n)) in a sorted vector
* Delete
O(n)

## Linked List

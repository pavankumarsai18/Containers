Analysis of clear() function
-----------------------------

The clear function takes O(1) because of the following reason:

# Code
template <typename T>
void Stack<T>::clear()
{
    items.clear(); // items is a vector
}

The implementaion of Stack is done by using a vector called "items".
The Stack<T>::clear() calls the clear function of the vector called "items". So the time complexity of
Stack<T>::clear() is the same as vector<T>::clear(). The clear function in vector just changes the member
data which keeps track of the size to 0. So the code for vector<T>::clear looks like the following:

# Code
void vector<T>::clear()
{
    size = 0;
}

Therefore clear function takes constant time, since it requires changing data of one element, which is a O(1)
operation. So, the Stack<T>::clear function takes O(1) time (or constant time) to be executed.
